# Create Msi Installer from Folder

Creat Wix Installer from Folder does exactly what is says on the tin. Pass it a folder (and some other options) and it will use Wix to create a deployable MSI from that folder.

The original use case for this was Scratch 3 but it can be used to create an MSI from any folder that contains an executable. It won't create any required registry so this can only be used to create MSIs for software that runs from a folder.

## Requirements

To use this script you need the following tools installed on your machine:

 - .Net Framework 4.0.30319 (with msbuild)
 - [Wix Toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/releases/)

Create a new MSI for Scratch 3:
```
.\create-msi-installer-from-folder.ps1 -Path "C:\Users\adam\AppData\Local\Programs\scratch-desktop" -Product "Scratch 3 Desktop" -Version "1.2.1" -executable "Scratch Desktop.exe"
```

During that process an upgrade GUID will have been outputed, when creating a new versions MSI suppy it to the script.

```
.\create-msi-installer-from-folder.ps1 -Path "C:\Users\adam\AppData\Local\Programs\scratch-desktop" -Product "Scratch 3 Desktop" -Version "1.2.2" -executable "Scratch Desktop.exe" -UpgradeGUID "foo"
```

These commands will create `.\build\Deploy\Release\Scratch 3 Desktop (1.2.1).msi` and `.\build\Deploy\Release\Scratch 3 Desktop (1.2.2).msi`
